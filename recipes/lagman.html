    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>½ pound beef chuck, cut into strips</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 carrot, cut into thin strips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large pot over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high; cook
        and stir onion in hot oil until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in beef
        strips, cumin, and black pepper; cook until beef is browned, about 5
        minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir carrot into the pot; cook until coated with tomato paste, 2 to 3
        minutes. Add green bell pepper; cook for 1 minute. Add potatoes and
        celery; cook for 5 minutes. Pour in water; bring to a boil. Season water
        with salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer soup until potatoes are soft,
        about 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir parsley and garlic into the soup. Simmer until garlic is soft, 10
        to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook noodles in
        boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite,
        3 to 5 minutes. Rinse and drain well. Divide among serving bowls. Ladle
        hot soup over noodles.
